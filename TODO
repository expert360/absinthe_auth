- Test a field with a custom resolver
- Test putting the permit clause after the resolver
- Test with other middlewares on a field (or elsewhere)
- Mutations
- Rename Middleware.Restriction to Rule.Permit
- Lists and connections
- Variables
- A set of helpers to make permissions easier (to extract args, context etc)
- A plug to set the permissions in the context
- Move authorisation state to a private field
- Docs!

Other ideas to consider later
- Passing functions to allow/allow_only
- Multiple rules for a field (allow, deny, allow_all/deny_all etc)
